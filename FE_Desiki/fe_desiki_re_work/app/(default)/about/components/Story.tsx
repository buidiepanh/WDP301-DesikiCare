              Founded in 2018, Desiki began as a personal journey to find
              skincare that was both effective and ethically produced. Our
              founder, after struggling with sensitive skin for years, began
              researching ingredients and formulations.

              What started as a small batch of handmade products for friends and
              family quickly grew into something bigger. The feedback was
              overwhelming â€“ people loved how their skin felt and looked after
              using our products.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Today, Desiki is committed to creating premium skincare that
              harnesses the power of natural ingredients while embracing
              scientific innovation. Every product is thoughtfully crafted,
              rigorously tested, and beautifully packaged.
